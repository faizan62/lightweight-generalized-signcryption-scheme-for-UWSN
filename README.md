# UWSN Simulation Project Overview

## Project Description
This project simulates an Underwater Wireless Sensor Network (UWSN) using a novel lightweight generalized signcryption scheme designed to enhance security and efficiency. The simulation tests various scenarios including network size, latency impacts, and energy consumption.

## File Descriptions
- `config_network_size_50.json` - Configuration for a network of 50 nodes.
- `config_high_latency.yml` - Configuration for simulating high latency conditions.
- `initialize_simulation.py` - Script to initialize the network simulation.
- `data_consumption_metrics.csv` - Logs data sent, received, and energy consumption metrics.
- `node01_private_key.pem` and `node01_public_key.pem` - Cryptographic keys for node 01.
- `analyze_performance.py` - Script to analyze the performance of the simulation.
- `README.md` - This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure Python and necessary libraries (`pandas`) are installed.
2. Configure the simulation settings in the JSON/YAML files as required.
3. Run `initialize_simulation.py` to set up the network nodes.
4. Use `analyze_performance.py` to compute and review performance metrics.
